Abstract
	The economic consequences of sea level rise are increasingly reflected in coastal insurance markets, where rising exposure to flooding and storm surge contributes to higher property insurance premiums. In response to escalating damages from extreme weather events, many coastal jurisdictions have proposed large-scale seawall construction as a climate adaptation strategy, though the economic justification for such investments remains uncertain. This paper evaluates the potential welfare effects of a proposed seawall in South Florida by examining whether reductions in insurance premiums could plausibly offset construction and maintenance costs. Using administrative insurance premium data from Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation (2009–2019) combined with sea-level information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the analysis develops a benefit–cost framework comparing scenarios with and without the seawall. Insurance premiums are used as a partial proxy for expected private-market damages associated with sea level rise. The paper identifies the threshold premium reduction required for the seawall investment to break even and discusses how geological constraints, public-good financing, and residual flood risk may limit observable insurance-market benefits. The findings illustrate how insurance-based metrics can inform, but not fully determine, the economic case for large-scale coastal defense infrastructure.

Introduction
There are many papers that project the damages from sea level rise to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars over the next couple of decades (Stanton and Ackerman 2007; Oppenheimer et al. 2019). Given the high costs associated with not constructing a seawall, insurance regulation and policy adaptation have become increasingly important tools for managing climate risk in coastal regions (Congressional Budget Office 2015). These costs are typically addressed through physical infrastructure such as seawall structures and drainage systems intended to prevent flood damage (Center for Climate Integrity 2019). Additional costs arise from increasing inclement weather, which raises construction standards near the coast and, in turn, increases overall development costs for coastal areas (Congressional Budget Office 2015). Florida has emerged as a prominent example of these dynamics, experiencing the compounding effects of sea level rise, extreme weather, and rising insurance costs (Stanton and Ackerman 2007).
In Florida, many analysts propose seawall structures, pumping systems, and new sewer systems to address flooding, storm surge, and high-tide-related impacts associated with sea level rise (Center for Climate Integrity 2019). At the same time, population growth in coastal regions continues to outpace growth in non-coastal areas, despite increasing insurance premiums and tighter development standards. The Congressional Budget Office reports that the population in coastal regions grows three times faster than in non-coastal regions, even as insurers raise premiums to internalize the costs of extreme weather and wind risk (Congressional Budget Office 2015).¹ This coexistence of rising risk, higher insurance costs, and continued coastal development raises questions about how households and firms perceive climate risk and how effectively adaptation policies mitigate it.
However, the seawall structures proposed for South Florida may not be as effective as similar projects implemented elsewhere due to region-specific geological constraints. A key challenge is the region’s porous limestone foundation, which underlies much of the built environment and allows water to move through the subsurface even when surface barriers are present (Stanton and Ackerman 2007; NOAA 2017). Even if a large seawall were constructed, storm surge and flooding could remain prevalent through subsurface pathways, limiting the extent to which expected damages—and therefore insurance premiums—are reduced.
This paper hypothesizes that constructing a seawall in South Florida will not reduce insurance premiums sufficiently to outweigh total construction and maintenance costs, resulting in a net negative social welfare effect when evaluated through this channel. Using insurance premiums as a partial proxy for expected private-market damages, the analysis develops a benefit–cost framework comparing scenarios with and without a seawall. The objective is to identify the magnitude of premium reductions required to justify such an investment and to assess whether those reductions are plausible given South Florida’s physical and institutional constraints.
Literature Review
The economic literature on coastal protection infrastructure emphasizes the scale of damages associated with extreme weather events and sea level rise, while offering mixed conclusions on the cost-effectiveness of large-scale seawall construction. High-profile disaster cases illustrate both the potential benefits and limitations of defensive infrastructure, particularly when geological and institutional contexts differ.
One strand of the literature documents the magnitude of losses from extreme coastal disasters and the subsequent policy response. The 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan caused an estimated $211 billion (2013 USD) in direct damages, making it the costliest natural disaster on record, with additional losses stemming from GDP contraction, supply-chain disruptions, and declines in tourism associated with radiation risk (Kajitani, Chang, and Tatano 2013). The disaster resulted in approximately 19,700 fatalities (Reconstruction Agency 2011). In response, Japan substantially expanded its coastal defenses, increasing seawall heights from approximately four meters to over twelve meters across roughly 245 miles of coastline, at a cost of approximately $12.7 billion (Siegel 2018). While these investments were motivated by risk reduction, subsequent studies and public commentary note concerns regarding visual blight, community disconnection from the coastline, and uncertainty about protection against events exceeding design thresholds (Jacobs 2018; Siegel 2018).
A parallel body of work examines large-scale coastal protection in the United States, most notably in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. Katrina caused approximately $40 billion in damages (Hartwig 2007) and resulted in an estimated 1,500 fatalities (Boyd 2006). Post-Katrina investments included an extensive system of levees and floodwalls, with reported costs exceeding $14 billion for key segments, designed to improve protection against storm surge and overtopping (RAND Corporation 2010). While these systems have reduced vulnerability to certain classes of storms, the literature emphasizes their dependence on continuous maintenance, institutional capacity, and assumptions about future hazard intensity, raising questions about long-run cost-effectiveness under climate change.
In the Florida context, prior research focuses on projected sea level rise and its implications for coastal exposure rather than on ex post evaluation of seawall effectiveness. Under business-as-usual emissions scenarios, mean sea level in Florida is projected to rise between 8.9 and 13.8 inches between 2000 and 2025, while more optimistic stabilization scenarios imply increases closer to 1.8 inches over the same period (Stanton and Ackerman 2007). These projections motivate substantial adaptation expenditures but also introduce uncertainty regarding the appropriate scale and timing of infrastructure investment. Cost estimates for seawall construction in South Florida vary widely, ranging from approximately $2.05 million to $26.37 million per mile, depending on design, materials, and local conditions (Yohe, Neumann, and Marshall 1999; Hope 2008; Kirshen et al. 2004). Given the extensive shoreline, comprehensive coverage could require expenditures between $8.2 billion and $105.5 billion. Consistent with these estimates, the Center for Climate Integrity projects that Florida could face seawall-related costs on the order of $76 billion by 2040 under conservative assumptions (Center for Climate Integrity 2019).
Despite the scale of these investments, the literature offers limited consensus on whether seawalls generate commensurate economic benefits across settings. Some studies suggest meaningful reductions in expected damages where storm surge is the dominant risk, while others highlight mixed or negligible effects in regions where flooding occurs through groundwater infiltration or drainage backflow. Importantly, few studies directly link seawall construction to observable outcomes in insurance markets, such as changes in premium levels or growth rates. This gap is particularly relevant for South Florida, where porous limestone geology may limit the effectiveness of perimeter defenses and attenuate any insurance-market response. By synthesizing evidence on disaster losses, projected sea level rise, and infrastructure costs, the existing literature motivates—but does not resolve—the question of whether large-scale seawalls in South Florida are economically justified.
